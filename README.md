## Introduction 
The purpose of this project is to serve as a tool for remembering your vocabulary when you are learning a foreign language. It encourages users to separate the words they know into different categories.

## Short History 
Initially, LLA 1.0 was one of my school projects. This was my fist time working with the MEAN stack and I had an especially rough experience with learning Angular. After finally mastering a bit of Angular, I came to the conclusion that the Angular frontend I built for version 1 was simply put unsightly to even look at. I decided to start over and so LLA 2.0 came about. LLA 2.0 was a definite improvement over the previous version but it was still lacking in many ways. I was still interested in both building an application of this kind and in working with the MEAN stack, particularly with Angular so I decided to start LLA 3.0.
