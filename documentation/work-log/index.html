                <p class="text-muted">Written on the 2nd of March 2019 by Maddie</p>
                <p class="boldened">What Worked</p>
                <ul>
                    <li> The API and the Angular client are in working condition! </li>
                    <li> I implemented the CRUD for the words.</li>
                    <li> I configured babel.js and it seems to work as intended. </li>
                    <li> I did some research and I have chosen let as the variable types for my dependencies.</li>
                    <li> I have been coding consistently this week and it felt quite nice (except for the times spend fixing bugs.)</li>
                    <li> I discovered a resource detailing the best practices for Node.js development and I plan to restructure/ refactor / change my API project to conform to these best practices as much as possible.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="boldened">What Didn't Work</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>I tried to build the APIs documentation using Swagger but it did not work. </li>
                    <li>I added some more functionalities to the API that I think I need/ want and now the code looks messy. </li>
                    <li>I have been reconsidering my decision to put the client and the api in the same repository - not sure if it is a good practice.</li>
                    <li>I still suffer because of lack of knowledge and time but hopefully I will get better with practice.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="boldened">Current Issues</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Both the API and the client require proper TESTING which I need to add!</li>
                    <li>The API still has no documentation.</li>
                    <li>Messy code in the API </li>
                    <li>Might need to remodel my Mongodb schema for words so it's more suited for my current needs.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="boldened">Possible Solutions</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Do lots of research on how to use Swagger with my project</li>
                    <li>Organize and restructure my API code using advice from the Node best practices </li>
                    <li>Look up and implement tests!</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="boldened">Next Week's Plan</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Work on implementing my possible solutions</li>
                    <li>Saturday - write the next work log entry! </li>
                </ul>

                <h4 id="week1">Reflection On Week 1 </h4>
                <p class="text-muted">Written on the 22nd of February 2019 by Maddie</p>
                <p class="boldened">What Worked</p>
                <ul>
                    <li> Finally started the Language Learning Application project (again); </li>
                    <li> The work for this project so far has been consistent and motivating; </li>
                    <li> Wrote some project documentation and gained a pretty clear idea of what I want to build; </li>
                    <li> Built the LLA3 API and currently it is in a working condition (good enough for my future
                        Angular client); </li>
                    <li> Had the pleasant experience of working again with Node, Express and MongoDB; </li>
                    <li> Testing the API using Postman - such a useful tool! </li>
                </ul>
                <p class="boldened">What Didn't Work</p>
                <ul>
                    <li> Stressed for time  - it has been a struggle for find enough time to work; </li>
                    <li> Unsure of some of the code that I wrote - either because it could be written better or because there might be a better way to make it do the same thing; </li>
                    <li> My Git commits - should have committed more often so there would not be such huge differences between the versions; </li>
                    <li> API Error - sending invalid JSON through the HTTP request triggers a 500 error so I need to fix that; </li>
                    <li> Lack of knowledge - I discovered that I need to refresh my knowledge about certain topics. </li>
                </ul>
                <p class="boldened">Current Issues</p>
                <ul>
                    <li> The variable type of my dependencies in app.js and in the other api files - Deciding between let, var and const.  </li>
                    <li> Should I use babel.js - ECMAScript 5 vs ECMAScript 6 Browser Compatibility Concerns  </li>
                    <li> API Future Improvements  </li>
                        <ul>
                            <li> API Documentation would be nice; </li>
                            <li> Based on the current app-tree diagram I might need to create one or two more endpoints to retrieve the exact data that I want to display on the frontend, for example all the languages / categories for a language for all the words in the database; </li>
                            <li> Validation and sanitization for the incoming HTTP requests, for example checking that the data I receive is in a correct JSON format; </li>
                        </ul>
                </ul>
                <p class="boldened">Possible Solutions</p>
                <ul>
                    <li> Plan and manage your time better! </li>
                    <li> Look up some developer best practices and stick to a code standard! </li>
                    <li> Be more mindful of your commits! </li>
                    <li> Do more testing! </li>
                    <li> Don't forget to document everything because you WILL forget!</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="boldened">Next Week's Plan</p>
                <ul>
                    <li> Start work on the Angular client (yay!); </li>
                    <li> Try to add the necessary improvements to the API; </li>
                    <li> Friday - write the next work log entry! </li>
